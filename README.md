# Australian Electric Vehicle Sales
An overview of Australian electric vehicle sales between <b>2011–2019.</b>

The premise of this study was to analyse <b>electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV)</b> vehicle sales in Australia – by state and in comparison to global uptake levels.

## Analysis 
### Australian EV/PHEV Sales - EV/PHEV vs. Total

Since 2011, there has been a <b>steady upward trend</b> in EV/PHEV vehicle purchases in Australia.

</p>

However, this gradual upward trend in EV/PHEV sales pales in comparison to the total number of vehicles sold in Australia.

### Australian EV/PHEV Sales - State

Of the total number of EV/PHEV sold in Australia, there has been a near-even distribution of sales amongst the states. However, as seen in the chart below, there has been a surge in EV/PHEV sales in South Australia (SA) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) – perhaps due to the implementation of battery-energy infrastructure in these regions.

### Charging Stations - Australia

The number of EV/PHEV charging stations across Australia has increased over time, relative to the number of EV/PHEV vehicles sold. The number of charging stations per state is also relative to each state's total population. However, there seems to be a shortage of charging stations in South Australia, as a result of the large number of EV/PHEV vehicles sold in the state.

## Global Vehicle Sales

Although there is an upward trend in EV/PHEV sales in Australia, this trend pales in comparison to the uptake of EV/PHEV vehicles globally.
